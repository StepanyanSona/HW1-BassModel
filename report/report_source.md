## 1. Introduction  
The Samsung Neo QLED 8K TV (QN900D) uses AI-powered upscaling to enhance lower-resolution content for an 8K display. This report applies the Bass Diffusion Model to predict its market adoption.  

## 2. Similar Innovation  
A comparable innovation is Sonyâ€™s first 4K Bravia TV (2012), which also relied on upscaling technology to bridge the content gap, much like Samsung's AI-driven 8K solution.  

## 3. Bass Diffusion Model  
We estimate the parameters:  
- **p (Innovation coefficient)**: Estimated from early adoption data  
- **q (Imitation coefficient)**: Derived from historical adoption trends  
- **M (Market potential)**: Approximate upper limit of adopters  

## 4. Adoption Forecast  
Using the Bass model, we predict adoption over time and visualize the diffusion curve.  

## 5. Conclusion  
The adoption of 8K TVs depends on content availability and price trends, mirroring the 4K adoption cycle. The Bass Model helps forecast when 8K will reach mass adoption.
